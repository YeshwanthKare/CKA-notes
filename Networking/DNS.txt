-> cat >> /etc/resolv.conf


==> CoreDNS requires a configuration file known as CoreDNS file, within this file a number of plugins configured

1. Plugins are configured for handling errors
2. reporting health, monitoring metrics, cache etc
3. The Plugin that works with kubernetes in CoreDNS is kubernetes plugin, that is why it is a top level domain name 
in the cluster is set

-> cat /etc/coredns/Corefile

-> The Corefile is passed into the pod as a config map object

-> kubectl get configmap -n kube-system


so likewise the DNS is resolved in the resolv.conf 


===============================================


The next thing is for the Pods to point to the CoreDNS server

what address the pods use to reach the DNS server?

-> kubectl get service -n kube-system

-> config file of kubelet - cat /var/lib/kubelet/config.yaml

-> host web-service - alternative to ns lookup for a service in kubernetes

-> host 10-244-2-5 - will not be found

-> host 10-244-2-5.default.pod.cluster.local - full FQDN should be specified
